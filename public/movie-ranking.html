<h1>The Best Movies According to Irvin!</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Avenger's Infinity War</h3>
<p>The penultimate climax to the original Avenger's movies. Arguably better than End Game. Don't @ me.</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>This is the perfect follow up to the 2005 Batman Begins. This movie encapulates what a sequel should be and what other sequels wish they could be.</p>
<h3>Star Wars Episode III</h3>
<p>Hayden Chritensen plays an amazing fallen Anakin. Everthing from the John WIllaims score to the visual effects that still amaze to this day just scream "masterpiece"!</p>
