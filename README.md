# html-portfolio
This is an introductory website to showcase my understanding and mastery of the HTML fundamentals. 
It is barebones and does reminisce of something that crawled out of the 1990's, but that is only becuase it was created using strictly HTML and nothing else. 
As times goes on I will create other websites and showcase other skills as I learn them.
